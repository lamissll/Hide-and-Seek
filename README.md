# Hide-and-Seek
Attempt for cross platform game. Pairs devices with bluetooth and start a 2D hide and seek game.  
This game was abandoned in the process despite of the android devices being correctly paired.  
As soon as I paired the devices i lost interest in the game concept and I started working on another project.

## IDE
Android Studio

## EXTERNAL LIBRARIES:
libgdx

## GAMEPLAY:
The game concept is that 2 users pair their devices through bluetooth (or more users through wifi direct, should have invested time on 
wifi direct instead of bluetooth) and then start a game of hide and seek in a dark apartment with 9x9 rooms. The seeker has to find 
the hiders and then rush to the starting point and disqualify them. The hiders have to hide and find the starting point of the seeker
and get to it. The hiders must do so in limited time.
